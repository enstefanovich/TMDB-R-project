# TMDB-R-project
This was my first R project for grad school. I worked on it in the Fall of 2023.
My goal was to find out which features of a movie could predict its revenue and average viewer score. I did so using descriptive statistics and linear regression.
The dataset comes from Kaggle, here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata
